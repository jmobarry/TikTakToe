# TikTakToe
Description: This exercise uses React and Babel to create a simulated TikTak toe game in the browser. Using React this program keeps track of numerous states on the gameboard.

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/TikTakToe/ Take alternating turns as player 1 and 2 until you get threee of a row of a kind (X or O). Press Refresh Game if you want to play another game.

Roadmap: I plan to include a win condition where if there is no winner when all of the squares are full an alert will be sent saying "It is a tie"
